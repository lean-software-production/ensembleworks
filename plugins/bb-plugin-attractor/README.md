# Attractor

A BB plugin that runs **Graphviz DOT workflow definitions** (the StrongDM
Attractor dialect, plus the Fabro extensions that matter for a software
factory) with **BB threads as the agent backend**, and renders the
**workflow DAG with live execution state** (current node, visited path,
per-node status, visit counts, timing) inside BB chat and the thread side
panel.

See `docs/plans/2026-09-13-attractor-runner-plan.md` (in the main
repository) for the full design, the supported DOT dialect, the engine
contracts, and the task breakdown this plugin is built against.

## Status

This is task T1: a scaffold only. `server.ts`, `app.tsx` and `host.ts` load
under the bb host but do nothing beyond a startup log line. The DOT
front-end, execution engine, BB-thread backend, storage, tools, CLI, RPC
surface, DAG UI and human gates all land in later tasks (T2–T7).

## Development

From this directory:

```sh
npm --cache "$PWD/.local/npm-cache" install
npm --cache "$PWD/.local/npm-cache" run typecheck
npm --cache "$PWD/.local/npm-cache" test
bb plugin build .
```

`.local/` (the npm cache override) is gitignored, along with `dist/` and
`node_modules/`.

## Deviations from the plan

None yet.
